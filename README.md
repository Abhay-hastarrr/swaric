##  Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhay-hastarrr/swaric.git
cd swaric
```

### 2. Install Root Dependencies

Install any dependencies required at the root level (if any):

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Project

SwARic is structured with separate `frontend` and `backend` folders for optimal performance and scalability.  
To run the application locally, start both servers in development mode using the following commands:

#### Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

This will launch the frontend development server with features like hot-reloading, serving the user interface on a local port (commonly [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

#### Start the Backend

Open a new terminal window/tab, then run:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

This will start the backend server, which handles all API requests, business logic, and data management. The backend typically runs on a separate local port (e.g., [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)).

> Note:
> Make sure to run both the frontend and backend servers in separate terminal windows/tabs so they remain active simultaneously.

---

##  Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to the frontend server's address (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
- Interact with the application—the frontend will communicate with the backend seamlessly to deliver the full SwARic experience.
